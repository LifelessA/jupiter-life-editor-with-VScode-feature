## 📐 Architecture & How It Works

### 🧠 Backend (PythonBridge)

* Executes Python code securely via `exec` and `eval`
* Captures:

  * Standard output
  * Exceptions
  * Matplotlib visualizations
  * Pandas DataFrames
* Maintains variables using `self.locals`
* Handles cell serialization and JSON save/load

### 🌐 Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)

* Uses **CodeMirror** for editing
* Markdown rendered live via **Marked.js**
* Communicates via `QWebChannel`
* Custom CSS and JavaScript control layout and logic

---

## 🎨 Customization & Theming

Update your UI through CSS variables in the HTML:

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #1e1e1e;
  --cell-bg: #2d2d2d;
  --border-color: #3a3a3a;
  --toolbar-bg: #252526;
}
```

You can also:

* Modify font families and sizes
* Tweak CodeMirror settings
* Add new keyboard shortcuts or UI widgets
